## Overview

`Bubblegum` is the Metaplex Protocol program for creating and interacting with Metaplex compressed NFTs (cNFTs).  Compressed NFTs are secured on-chain using Merkle trees.

With Bubblegum you can:
* Create a tree.
* Delegate authority for a tree.
* Mint a cNFT to a tree.
* Verify/unverify creators.
* Verify/unverify membership of a cNFT to a Metaplex Verified Collection.
* Transfer ownership of a cNFT.
* Delegate authority for a cNFT.
* Burn a cNFT.
* Redeem a cNFT and decompress it into an uncompressed Token Metadata NFT.
* Batch-mint a complete tree with verified creators and a single Metaplex Verified Collection.

## Background

Compressed NFTs differ from uncompressed NFTs in where their state (metadata, owner, etc.) is stored.  For uncompressed NFTs, all state data is stored in on-chain accounts.  This tends to be expensive at scale.  Compressed NFTs save space by encoding the state data into a Merkle tree.  This means that the detailed account data is not stored on-chain, but in data stores managed by RPC providers.

Compressed NFTs are secured on-chain by the hashing of the state data when it is added to the Merkle tree.  The Merkle root is a hash that cryptographically secures the state data for all of the leaves (NFTs) contained in the tree.

In the unlikely scenario that all RPC providers were to lose their data stores, the off-chain state of compressed NFTs could be recovered by replaying transactions (provided that the given tree was started from the beginning).

Compressed NFTs can also be losslessly decompressed into uncompressed Metaplex NFTs.  Decompression will cost rent for the Metadata and Master Edition `token-metadata` program accounts that need to be created.

### Batch operations

As was observed, minting of assets constitutes over 90% of all operations pertaining to digital assets. In order to reduce the number of transactions and optimize the time and cost it takes to put your tree on-chain during the Solana heavy load events Metaplex has introduced the batch-mint operations. The batch extension to the Bubblegum program introduces offline Merkle tree creation, enabling users to prepare and manage Merkle trees offline before finalizing them on-chain. The resulting trees are fully compatible with the regular trees. The snapshot of the tree created is required to be stored off-chain so the replay of the tree creation is possible on any indexer.

## Basic operation

### Creating and minting to a tree

Anyone can create a tree using `create_tree` and then they are the tree owner.  They can also delegate authority to another wallet.

### Merkle proofs

After a cNFT is minted, for any operations that modify the cNFT, Merkle proofs must be provided with the instruction to validate the Merkle tree changes.  Bubblegum is an Anchor program and makes use of the remaining accounts feature for this purpose.  Merkle proofs are added as remaining account `Pubkey`s that are 32-byte Keccak256 hash values that represent the nodes from the Merkle tree that are required to calculate a new Merkle root.

### Creator verification

Creators are specified in a creators array in the metadata passed into the `mint_v1` instruction.  All creators for which `verified` is set to true in the creators array at the time of mint must be a signer of the transaction or the mint will fail.  Beyond the signers specified in the `MintV1` Account validation structure, the `mint_v1` instruction uses remaining accounts to optionally look for additional signing creators.  This does not conflict with the Merkle proofs requirement because proofs are not required for minting.

Beyond verifying creators at the time of mint, there are `verify_creator` and `unverify_creator` instructions that can be used on existing Compressed NFTs.

### Collection verification

Note that there is no such thing as compressed Verified Collections.  Collections are still NFTs created in the realm of Metadata and Master Edition `token-metadata` accounts. There are instructions to `verify_collection` and `unverify_collection`, as well as a `set_and_verify_collection` instruction for the case where the collection was set during the mint. `mint_to_collection_v1` is an instruction can be used to mint and verify a collection at the same time. Currently `decompress_v1` will fail for verified collection compressed assets, and will only be successful for unverified / no collection compressed assets. The complete flow for decompressing a verified asset would be to unverify its collection, decompress, and reverify collection through traditional means.
All of these require either the true Collection Authority to be a a signer, or a delegated Collection Authority to be a signer along with providing a Collection Authority Record PDA.  See the Metaplex documentation on [`Certified Collections`](https://docs.metaplex.com/programs/token-metadata/certified-collections) for more information on verifying collections.

### Transfer ownership, delegate authority, and burn a cNFT

Compressed NFTs support transferring ownership, delegating authority, and burning the cNFT.  See the [Instructions](##Instructions) section below for details.

### Redeem a cNFT and decompress it into an uncompressed Token Metadata NFT

Redeeming a cNFT removes the leaf from the Merkle tree and creates a voucher PDA account.  The voucher account can be sent to the `decompress_v1` instruction to decompress the cNFT into a Token Metadata NFT.  As mentioned above this will cost rent for the Metadata and Master Edition `token-metadata` accounts that are created during the decompression process.  Note that after a cNFT is redeemed but before it is decompressed, the process can be reversed using `cancel_redeem`.  This puts the cNFT back into the Merkle tree.

## Batch-Mint Operations

### Introduction
The latest extension to the Bubblegum contract introduces batch-mint operations, allowing users to mint multiple cNFTs in just several transactions, which significantly reduces on-chain overhead and optimizes minting processes for large collections.

### How It Works
With the batch-mint operations, users can prepare an entire set of NFTs off-chain, populate them within a Merkle tree structure, and then mint them to the tree in a small number of transactions. This process is designed to handle large-scale NFT collections more efficiently.

### Steps to Perform a Batch-Mint

In order to simplify the Merkle tree creation and interactions we recommend using the [SDK](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/rollup-sdk).

To understand the batch-mint flow, let's recall the structure of a tree data account:

```
+--------+----------------------+-----------------+
| Header |     Tree body        |     Canopy      |
+--------+----------------------+-----------------+
   56      depends on the tree    (2‚Åø‚Å∫¬π - 2) * 32
  bytes    depth and buffer size       bytes
```
where n is the depth of the canopy.

1. **Prepare Tree**
  - Invoke the `prepare_tree` method to initialize an account with a tree header and an empty tree body and empty canopy buffer.
  - The tree is set up with initial parameters (tree size and canopy if required) but remains empty, allowing offline filling.

2. **Fill Tree Offline**
  - User populates the tree offline, ensuring all necessary leaves are in place.
  - If the canopy is required, then canopy leaf nodes are populated in the process of adding asset leaves to tree.
  - The final root, proof, and last leaf are prepared for submission.

3. **Serialize and Upload the Tree**
  - The offline tree is serialized and uploaded to an IPFS-like service, such as Arweave, ensuring public access.

4. **Adding canopy (for a tree with a canopy)**
  - To transfer canopy leaf nodes from offline tree to the solana tree data account the `add_canopy` method is invoked, tree body at this stage stays empty

5. **Finalize Tree**
  - To finalize the tree the methods `finalize_tree_with_root` for a tree without verified collections or `finalize_tree_with_root_and_collection` for a tree with one verified collection are used. Signatures from both the tree owner and a designated staker are required.
  - The staker is responsible for ensuring the data's availability and consistency, verifying it before signing off.

6. **Manage the Tree**
   - Once the batch minting process is complete, you can manage the tree and its NFTs using all the standard Bubblegum operations.
   - You can also mint additional assets into a batch-minted tree as if it's a regular tree.

## Accounts

### üìÑ `tree_authority`

The `tree_authority` PDA account data stores information about a Merkle tree.  It is initialized by `create_tree` and is updated by all other Bubblegum instructions except for decompression.
The account data is represented by the [`TreeConfig`](program/src/state/mod.rs#L17) struct.

| Field                              | Offset | Size | Description
| ---------------------------------- | ------ | ---- | --
| &mdash;                            | 0      | 8    | Anchor account discriminator.
| `tree_creator`                     | 8      | 32   | `PubKey` of the creator/owner of the Merkle tree.
| `tree_delegate`                    | 40     | 32   | `PubKey` of the delegate authority of the tree.  Initially it is set to the `tree_creator`.
| `num_minted`                       | 72     | 8    | `u64` that keeps track of the number of NFTs minted into the tree.  This value is very important as it is used as a nonce ("number used once") value for leaf operations to ensure the Merkle tree leaves are unique.  The nonce is basically the tree-scoped unique ID of the asset.  In practice for each asset it is retrieved from off-chain data store.

### üìÑ `voucher`

The `voucher` PDA account is used when a cNFT is redeemed and decompressed.  It is initialized by `redeem` and represented by the [`Voucher`](program/src/state/mod.rs#L39) struct, which includes a reference to the [`LeafSchema`](program/src/state/leaf_schema.rs#L40) struct.

| Field                             | Offset | Size | Description
| --------------------------------- | ------ | ---- | --
| &mdash;                           | 0      | 8    | Anchor account discriminator.
| `leaf_schema`                     | 8      | 32   | `PubKey` of the creator/owner of the Merkle tree.
| `index`                           | 40     | 32   | `PubKey` of the delegate authority of the tree.  Initially it is set to the `tree_creator`.
| `merkle_tree`                     | 72     | 32   | `PubKey` of the Merkle tree to which the leaf belonged before it was redeemed.
